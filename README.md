#  qooxdoo contrib 

This repository is part of the qooxdoo contrib(ution) system, qooxdoo's "plugin" architecture. contribs are qooxdoo libraries that 
can be loaded on-demand, using a [CLI](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo-cli#qooxdoo-command-line-interface). 

See [here](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo-cli#how-to-list-get-your-contrib-repository-listed-with-qx-contrib-list) on how to integrate
your contrib library with this system. 

We store a cache of json data here which is generated hourly from querying the GitHub API. Please **do not rely** on the structure of
