This repository is part of the qooxdoo contrib(ution) system, qooxdoo's "plugin" architecture. contribs are qooxdoo libraries that 
can be loaded on-demand, using a [CLI](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo-cli#qooxdoo-command-line-interface). 

We store a cache of json data here which is generated **daily** from querying the GitHub API. If you need more frequent updates, use a GitHub Access token with your CLI commands. Please **do not rely** on the structure of this data, as it can change any time.
